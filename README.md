# The Price is Right

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests.

Your task is to implement a `calculateTotal` function which returns a new list of items. Each item will be a copy of the previous item but will have a new attribute named `total`. The value of `total` must be equal to the total price of that item. This exercise will be completed in class.
